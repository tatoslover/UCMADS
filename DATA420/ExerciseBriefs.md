# DATA420-23S2 (C) Exercise 1

A lot of this course will require a combination of problem solving and computer programming, and you should have the solution to the problem sketched out on paper or in your mind before you start programming.
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems are too complex or time consuming to solve by hand, but they can be solved quickly by using efficient computer programming. You can find the problems online at https://projecteuler.net/archives/.
(a) Solve problems 1, 5, and 10.
(b) Now solve them again using a different programming language or method.
